# Database Migration Required

The profile page functionality requires new database columns. You need to apply the database migration to add profile and billing features.

## Quick Fix - Apply Migration in Supabase Dashboard

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → SQL Editor

2. **Copy and paste the contents** of this file:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/PROFILE_BILLING_SCHEMA.sql
   ```

3. **Click "RUN"** to execute the migration

This will add the required columns:
- `profile_picture_url` to users table  
- `subscription_status` and `subscription_tier` to users table
- New tables: `subscriptions`, `payment_methods`, `invoices`

## What This Enables

After running the migration, users will be able to:
- ✅ Upload and manage profile pictures
- ✅ Edit personal information (name, email, username)
- ✅ View subscription status (billing features ready for Stripe integration)
- ✅ Access account settings and security options

## Current Status

The profile page will work with basic functionality even without the migration, but profile pictures and subscription features require the database updates.

## Alternative: Using Supabase CLI (if installed)

If you have Supabase CLI installed:
```bash
supabase db push
```

This will apply all pending migrations automatically.
